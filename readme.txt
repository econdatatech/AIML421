I used a 16 core Jupiter server on saturn cloud pro to do the number crunching.
The first cell is just to be able to install pandas-profiling and some other stuff. 
Takes less efforts in google colab but donâ€™t have the number crunching capacity there.
The rest of the notebook is pretty straight forward and should run anywhere.
