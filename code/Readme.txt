I assume the images with be in class subfolders in the testdata. Otherwise the model wouldn't have the ground truth and couldn't report performance back

I also included the ipynb file in which I ran most of my experiments.
The train.py is a very stripped down version of this just focussing on my best/final model.

I had some trouble in Saturn Cloud to run it on the command line. But the same code in a jupyter notebook runs fine.
Don't know about ECS computers... don't have access to them (working full time).
